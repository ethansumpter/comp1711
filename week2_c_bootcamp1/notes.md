# Notes for Week 2 C Bootcamp

- To create and launch a code file in bash use the 'code ...' command
- The line of code: #include <stdio.h>, includes the standard input/output library
- the int main() {} function is the main body of the C code. int returns an integer value from the function.
- Every line in C ends with a semi-colon ;
- The bash command gcc first.c -o first will compile the C file. Every change made to the program must be compiled.
- The compiled file can be executed using the './first' command replacing first with the compiled file name. This will run in the terminal.
- ALT, SHFT, F will auto-format code with indentation, etc..
- When scanning for an input if the & symbol is infront of the variable then the address location is taken in.
- A float will be a decimal number, whereas an integer is a whole number.
- Strings don't exist in C, instead create an array of characters.
